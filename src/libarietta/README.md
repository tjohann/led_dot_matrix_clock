LIBARIETTA
=========

A collection of basic functions. (see also https://tjohann.wordpress.com/)


What is libarietta?
-------------------
The functions within this library are the fundament of my LED-Dot-matrix based clock. They provide easy access to network, lcd or other components of the system. 

I provide a dynamic lib and also a static lib with cmake config(s). For an easy use, include libarietta.h and take a look at the functions in the header, or read the manpage

   man 3 libarietta
